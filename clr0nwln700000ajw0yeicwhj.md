In the rapidly evolving world of cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands out as a leader. AWS provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services that enable businesses and developers to build, deploy, and scale applications with ease. One powerful tool in the AWS arsenal is the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), a command-line tool that allows users to interact with AWS services directly from the command line.

## Why AWS CLI?

* **Automation:** AWS CLI allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing the likelihood of human error.
    
* **Scripting:** It's scriptable, enabling you to create custom scripts for various AWS tasks.
    
* **Flexibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing flexibility for users on different platforms.
