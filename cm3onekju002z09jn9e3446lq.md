Amazon EC2 offers various storage options tailored for different workloads. Letâ€™s explore them in detail with simple explanations and steps to get started.

---

### **1\. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

Amazon EBS is a persistent block storage system for EC2 instances. Think of it as a virtual hard drive.

#### **Key Features of EBS:**

* **Persistent Data:** Retains data even if the instance is stopped (but not terminated unless the volume is deleted).
    
* **Performance:** Ideal for transactional workloads like databases or running apps.
    
* **Customizable Sizes and Types:** You can adjust the volume size and type based on your needs.
    

#### **How to Attach an EBS Volume to an Instance:**

1. **Create a Volume:**
    
    * In the AWS Console, go to **EC2 Dashboard** &gt; **Elastic Block Store** &gt; **Volumes**.
        
    * Click **Create Volume**.
        
    * Specify the size (e.g., 10 GB) and type (e.g., gp3 for general SSD).
        
2. **Attach to an Instance:**
    
    * Select the volume.
        
    * Click **Actions** &gt; **Attach Volume**.
        
    * Choose the EC2 instance you want to attach it to.
        
3. **Mount the Volume (Linux):**
    
    * Log in to the EC2 instance.
        
    * Use commands like `lsblk` to find the volume and mount it.

### **2\. EBS Snapshots**

Snapshots are backups of EBS volumes. They are stored in Amazon S3 and can be used to restore or duplicate volumes.

#### **Why Snapshots Are Useful:**

* **Disaster Recovery:** Restore lost data.
    
* **Volume Replication:** Create new volumes in the same or a different region.
    

#### **Steps to Create an EBS Snapshot:**

1. Go to **Elastic Block Store** &gt; **Volumes** in the AWS Console.
    
2. Select a volume.
    
3. Click **Actions** &gt; **Create Snapshot**.
    
4. Provide a description (e.g., "Backup for app data").
    
5. Click **Create Snapshot**.

### **3\. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**

An AMI is a pre-configured template containing an operating system and any applications you need to launch EC2 instances.

#### **Why Use AMIs?**

* Launch multiple identical instances.
    
* Save your instance's current state for later use.
    

#### **Steps to Create an AMI:**

1. Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
    
2. Select your running instance.
    
3. Click **Actions** &gt; **Create Image**.
    
4. Provide an image name and description.
    
5. Click **Create Image**. It will appear under **AMIs**.

### **4\. EC2 Instance Store**

Instance Store is temporary storage directly attached to an EC2 instance.

#### **Key Points:**

* **Fast but Temporary:** Data is lost if the instance stops or restarts.
    
* **Use Case:** Temporary files like caches.
    

No setup is needed; it's automatically included with some instance types.

### **5\. EBS Volume Types**

EBS offers different volume types for various workloads:

| **Type** | **Best For** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General Purpose SSD (gp3) | Most workloads | Web servers, dev environments |
| Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) | High-performance apps | Databases |
| Throughput Optimized HDD | Streaming large data | Big data, logs |
| Cold HDD | Infrequent access | Archive storage |

---

### **6\. EBS Multi-Attach**

This feature allows multiple EC2 instances to access a single EBS volume simultaneously.

#### **Why Use Multi-Attach?**

* Shared storage for clustered apps or distributed systems.
    

**Note:** Only available for io1 and io2 volumes.

---

### **7\. EBS Encryption**

EBS encryption ensures data at rest and in transit is secure.

#### **How to Enable Encryption:**

1. Go to **Volumes** in the EC2 Dashboard.
    
2. Select a volume.
    
3. Click **Actions** &gt; **Modify Volume**.
    
4. Enable **Encryption** and save.

### **8\. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**

EFS is a shared file storage system accessible by multiple EC2 instances.

#### **Why Use EFS?**

* Automatically scales as data grows.
    
* Ideal for applications requiring shared storage.
    

#### **How to Use EFS:**

1. Go to **EFS** in the AWS Console.
    
2. Create a new file system.
    
3. Attach it to your EC2 instances using NFS.

### **9\. EFS vs. EBS**

| **Feature** | **EFS** | **EBS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | File system | Block storage |
| **Access** | Shared by multiple instances | Single instance (or Multi-Attach) |
| **Use Case** | Shared storage, web servers | Databases, OS boot volumes |
| **Performance** | Scales with usage | High IOPS for critical apps |
| **Cost** | Higher per GB | Cheaper per GB |

### **Conclusion**

Understanding EC2 storage is key to managing your workloads efficiently. Start with EBS for general needs, explore Snapshots for backups, use AMIs for automation, and try EFS for shared storage. Practice with the steps outlined to get hands-on experience!
