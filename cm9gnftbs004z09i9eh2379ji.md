Ever wondered what happens when you press the power button on your Linux computer or server? It doesn’t just *magically* turn on and show you a login screen—there’s a step-by-step **booting process** happening in the background. Let's break it down in a super simple way.

## 🧠 What is Booting?

**Booting** is the process of starting up a computer from a powered-off state and loading the operating system (Linux, in our case) so you can begin using it.

## 📚 6 Steps of the Linux Boot Process

Here’s a visual to help you grasp the overall idea:

Let’s walk through these steps one by one:

---

### 🔌 1. **BIOS / UEFI (Firmware Stage)**

* **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or **UEFI** (newer version) is the first thing that runs when you power on.
    
* It checks and initializes hardware like RAM, keyboard, CPU, etc.
    
* After checking, it looks for a **bootable device** (Hard disk, USB, CD).
    

🔎 **BIOS Goal**: Find and load the Bootloader.

> 🧠 Think of BIOS/UEFI as the computer's security guard checking everything before letting anyone in.

---

### 🧱 2. **MBR / GPT (Disk Partition Info)**

* BIOS reads the **MBR** (Master Boot Record) or **GPT** (GUID Partition Table).
    
* MBR contains the location of the **bootloader**.
    

🧭 **Purpose**: Locate the Bootloader in storage.

> 📦 MBR is like the table of contents telling the computer where to find the next chapter.

---

### 🧰 3. **Bootloader (GRUB)**

* The **bootloader** is a small program, usually **GRUB** (GRand Unified Bootloader).
    
* It displays the menu to choose which OS to load (if you have multiple OSes).
    
* Then, it loads the **Linux Kernel**.
    

📌 **GRUB location**: Usually found in `/boot` directory.

> 🧭 GRUB is like the menu in a restaurant letting you choose what to eat (which OS to run).

---

### 🧵 4. **Kernel Initialization**

* The **Linux Kernel** is the core of the operating system.
    
* It initializes the hardware and loads drivers (like for your keyboard, network, storage).
    
* Then it mounts the **root filesystem** (`/` directory) and starts **init** process.
    

🧠 **Kernel Job**: Prepare the system to run software.

---

### ⚙️ 5. **init / systemd (Initialization Stage)**

* `init` or `systemd` is the **first process** started by the kernel (PID 1).
    
* It starts all the necessary services like networking, login screen, etc.
    

🔧 **systemd** is most commonly used in modern Linux.

> 🧰 Think of systemd as the event manager starting everything for the party (your system).

---

### 🔐 6. **Login & Shell**

* Finally, you reach the **login prompt** or **GUI**.
    
* After logging in, the shell or desktop is ready to use!
    

🎉 Now you can start running your applications!

## 🖼️ Visual Recap of Linux Booting

Here's another visual summary:

## 💡 Real-Life Example

Imagine you turn on your laptop:

1. BIOS runs → Checks hardware.
    
2. MBR points to GRUB → GRUB menu shows.
    
3. GRUB loads Kernel → Kernel initializes system.
    
4. Kernel starts systemd → Systemd starts services.
    
5. You see the login screen.
    

That's it!
